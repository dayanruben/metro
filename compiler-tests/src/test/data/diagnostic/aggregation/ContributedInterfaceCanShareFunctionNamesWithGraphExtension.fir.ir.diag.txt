/ContributedInterfaceCanShareFunctionNamesWithGraphExtension.kt:(187,195): error: [Metro/IncompatibleOverrides] The following declarations clash with each other when merging supertypes into a generated `MyGraph` graph impl class:

  ContributedInterfaceCanShareFunctionNamesWithGraphExtension.kt:12:3
    fun dependency(): Dependency (defined in 'MyGraph')
  ContributedInterfaceCanShareFunctionNamesWithGraphExtension.kt:21:1
    @Provides @dev.zacsweers.metro.SingleIn(kotlin.Unit::class) fun dependency(): Dependency (defined in 'Bindings')

Declarations with the same name and compatible return types must have compatible DI annotations too. Otherwise, these can lead to ambiguous/undefined behavior at runtime.
