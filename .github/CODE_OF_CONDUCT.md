# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community
* Respecting maintainers' time and not asking for ETAs

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Ignoring repo maintainers' requests to move comments/questions to more appropriate avenues
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## AI/LLM Policy

Using AI as a helper tool is fine. The issue isn't whether you used AI, it's whether you
did the work of reviewing, understanding, and refining the output before sharing it. We
have a few expectations around AI use in project spaces (issues, pull requests,
discussions, etc.).

**Do not submit AI-generated walls of text as your own comments.** When you paste raw
LLM output into an issue, PR description, or comment, you are offloading the work of
interpreting and condensing that output onto maintainers and other contributors. 
This is disrespectful of others' time. Maintainers may close or ignore 
issues/PRs/comments that appear to be unreviewed AI output.

**AI-assisted contributions to code are welcome, provided you've done your due diligence.**
If you use AI to help write code in a PR, you must disclose this (see the
[pull request template](pull_request_template.md)). You are still fully responsible for
understanding, testing, and defending any code you submit. "the AI wrote it" is not an
acceptable explanation for bugs or design decisions. Indicate what parts are AI-generated
and de-fluff _before_ opening the PR.

**What's fine:**
* Using AI to help with boilerplate, mechanical refactors, or tedious repetition
* Using AI to brainstorm or take on a narrowly-focused bugfix or change
* Using AI to help you understand unfamiliar parts of the codebase
* Using AI for translation assistance when writing in English as a non-native speaker

**What's not fine:**
* Pasting raw AI output as issue descriptions, comments, or PR descriptions without
  reviewing, condensing, and rewriting it in your own words
* Submitting AI-generated code without understanding what it does or why
* Using AI to generate speculative feature requests or design proposals you haven't
  thought through yourself

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
pandanomic@gmail.com.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.
